I have chosen the Ball Balancing Bot project 
because it is  the fusion of mechanical design, 
control systems, and sensor integration. In this 
project we have the challenge of maintaining 
dynamic stability on a 2-DOF platform, 
especially without relying on vision systems, 
which  offers us an interesting opportunity to go 
deeper  into advanced control strategies and 
sensor technologies. This project not only 
enhances my understanding of real-time system 
responses but it also pushes the boundaries of 
traditional robotics by exploring alternative 
sensing methods and actuator configurations.
